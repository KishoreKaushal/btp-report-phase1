\chapter{\the\chapname}

In this chapter we will discuss the steps required to create a basic MAAS based virtual cloud environment. Remember that the problem statement is to repurpose the commodity hardware to create an experimental cloud. At present we don't have access to those hardwares hence we are conducting our experiments in a virtualized environment.
