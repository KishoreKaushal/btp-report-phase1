\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}
    \begin{block}{Experimental Cloud using Commodity Hardware}
        The objective of this project is to create an experimental cloud by repurposing commodity hardware. The cloud we create would be made available to students as virtual desktops which may be used to host web services which can vary from simple static page to complex web applications.
