\begin{frame}{Major Milestones}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item MAAS based cloud in VENV
        \item Hardware Assembly and Configuration
        \item Deploying cloud server
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Things that I learnt so far...}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Docker \& Containerization (might need in future)
        \item MAAS (a provisioning construct created by Canonical)
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Progress Report}
    \begin{block}{MAAS in VENV}
        The problem statement is to repurpose the commodity hardware to create an experimental cloud. At present we don't have access to those hardwares hence we are conducting our experiments in a virtualized environment.
